# Port-Manipulation_AT328p
It's not very often that I program an Arduino (or Chinese knock-off) through port manipulation (directly controlling the registers) so I usually have to look things back up whenever I do. This is just a reference I created for myself when there's a need to do so, but I put it here thinking others may find it useful as well.
